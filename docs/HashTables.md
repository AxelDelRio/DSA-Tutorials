# HASH TABLES

A Hash Table is a collection of <key, value> pairs, each pair is called an "entry"

EX: if we have a key as an int and String as the value, this is what it would look like:

432, "Banana"
654, "Strawberry"
765, "Mango"

Now to put this entry in our table, we need to hash our key then module it by the capacy of our table, Here is a diagram of that process:
